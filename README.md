# ros-turtle-demo

Requires install of docker-ce on your platform to build and run container.

See http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim for more information.
(Everything up to and including "rosrun turtlesim ..." is done for you....)

Once started, to see the simulation window, run a browser on the same machine, with the URL:
http://localhost:8080/vnc_auto.html

For development, including editing and running code, from a separate terminal window run:
docker exec -it turtle bash

Then proceed with tutorials, for example:
